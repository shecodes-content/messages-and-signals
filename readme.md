# Messages and Signals

All living things communicate in some way: The flower signals the bee that it has some interesting resources to offer by means of vibrant coloured blooms and a nice fragrant. At home in the hive, the bee tells their friends where to find that altruistic flower by encoding its position into a dance performance! (And the flower, not being that altruistic after all, is pretty happy to have its DNA spread across the land, but that is a different story)

Some codes are being used for inter-species communication (flower to bee), others, like the bee-dance, can only be decoded by members of the same species.

One of them, humans, invented two new categories – codes for human-machine communication and codes for machine-machine communication. How and why this happened is a story of love, death and despair and we’ll get to it in a bit.
